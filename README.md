# Text-Classification-using-NLTK-and-Sklearn
In this project, we basically detect that the given text message is spam or not using NLP(Natural Language Processing),

We have achieved an accuracy score of 98.70 %.
We have tried out different types of sklearn classifiers with given accuracies:-
KK Nearest Neighbors -->  94.68772433596554
Decision Tree        -->  97.5592246949031
Random Forest        -->  98.20531227566404
Logistic Regression  -->  98.7078248384781
SGD Classifier       -->  98.20531227566404
Naive Bayes          -->  98.1335247666906
SVM Linear           -->  98.34888729361091

Then trying out ensemble method - VotingClassifier which gave an accuracy score of 98.70 approx.
